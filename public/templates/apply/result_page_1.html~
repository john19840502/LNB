					Pay us in cash at the due date -> You pay the principal plus interest amounts at mm/dd/yyyy. During that period, we pre-authorize or put a hold on your credit card for the principal and interest amounts. We deduct from your borrowing amount the credit card pre-authorization or hold fee of 4% and either wire fee of $25 or no wire fee (this depends on which option the customer chose for the delivery option above) so you will receive your borrowing amount minus the credit card pre-authorization or hold fee minus the wire fee or no wire fee.

					Early Pay-> With early pay, you know for sure that you do not want to go through the hassle of sending us the check or wire the money to us so we offer early pay for you to use your credit card to pay us now so we charge your credit card for the principal and interest. We deduct from your borrowing amount the credit card processing fee of 4% and either wire fee of $25 or no wire fee (this depends on which option the customer chose for the delivery option above). As you pay us early, we give you 3% discount on your interest APR in return. In summary, you will receive your borrowing amount minus the credit card pre-authorization or hold fee and minus the wire fee or no wire fee.
